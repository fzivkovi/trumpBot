Our starting point was code: https://github.com/suriyadeepan/easy_seq2seq, where the seq2seq_model.py was basically copied straight from tensorflow/tensroflow/models/tutorials/rnn/translate/. Used in same way.
This repo had added some useful extensions which I am using (decode function for chatting, perplexity calculation, GUI, etc.).
